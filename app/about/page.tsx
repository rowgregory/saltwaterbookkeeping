              Welcome to Saltwater Bookkeeping! I&apos;m thrilled to offer my services to small
              businesses and entrepreneurs who need reliable, accurate bookkeeping solutions.
            </span>
            <span className="mt-7 text-15 roboto-regular">
              After a successful career in technology, specializing in data management, I decided to
              bring my expertise into the world of bookkeeping. My attention to detail, technical
              background, and passion for helping others achieve financial clarity inspired me to
              start Saltwater Bookkeeping.
            </span>
            <span className="mt-7 text-15 roboto-regular">
              My journey in tech gave me a deep understanding of the importance of well-organized
              data and systems, and I now use those skills to streamline bookkeeping processes for
              my clients. I aim to simplify financial management, allowing business owners to focus
              on what they do bestâ€”growing their businesses.
            </span>
            <span className="mt-7 text-15 roboto-regular">
              Outside of bookkeeping, I&apos;m a mother of three, grandmother of three, and enjoy
              spending time by the ocean.
            </span>
            <span className="mt-7 text-15 roboto-regular">
              Whether you&apos;re looking to get your finances organized or need ongoing support,
              I&apos;m here to help!
